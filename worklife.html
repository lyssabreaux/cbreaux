<h1>Work Life</h1>
<p>My dad currently works for Muni in San Francisco as a Information Systems Prinicipal Engineer. He has been working there since 2012. Before 2012, he was working at San Francisco Chronicle and before that he worked on the Clipper Program. While working my dad has made friends with most of his coworkers who I have had the privelege of meeting every now and then.</p>
